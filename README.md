# testffi

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## some commands for dart

dart pub get      -> downloading dependencies
flutter run       -> runs the app from terminal
flutter run --hot -> enables hot reloading. This means that after the initial build, you can make code changes and see them reflected in the running app without having to rebuild the entire app.
